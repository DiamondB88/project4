# Animal Memes
## created by Alyssa Kieffer & Stevie Burnette

### Technology
The Animeme app was created using React, Ruby on Rails & Postgres.

### Approach
The approach taken was by following notes in order to ensure no mistakes were made in order to meet MVP.

### Unsolved Problems
One issue that we faced was integrating an image header, which has been achieved many times before in other languages. When adding a jpg or png file, the routes were somehow lost in translation and no matter the many troubleshooting attempts that we tried, we had no success.

Additionally, the cancel button was not successfully curated for the Edit and Create forms. Instead of completely nixing the idea, Stevie opted to hide the button so that a later attempt at functionality could be made. 

### Additional Time
If time allowed, we had hoped to integrate a User feature for a One to Many relationship. Unfortunately we were not granted that amount of time and were not able to meet this goal. We erred on the side of cautiousness for this project solely due to not being as comfortable with React as we had hoped.
